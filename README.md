## Project Plan

- Develop a CRUD application for [describe the system, e.g., a medical consultation system].
- Use Laravel 11 for backend logic and database management.
- Integrate Flowbite for responsive UI components and a modern user experience.

### Tasks and Timeline
- **Week 1**: 
    - Set up the Laravel 11 environment and create the basic project structure
    - Develop database models and migrations for [e.g., users, dokter, pasien, konsultasis].
- **Week 2**: 
    - Implement CRUD functionality.
    - Integrate Flowbite components into Blade templates for UI consistency.
    - Test and finalize the application.

## Results

### Functionalities Achieved
[✓] Users can create, read, update, and delete [e.g., consultation records]. <br/>
[✓] Patients can book and delete appointments with doctors. <br/>
[✓] Doctors can view their appointments and accept or reject consultations. <br/>
[✓] Flowbite components integrated for navigation, modals, and form inputs. <br/>
  
### Challenges and Solutions
1. **Challenge**: Integrating Flowbite with Blade templates.<br/>
    **Solution**: Customized Flowbite’s components to align with Blade templating structure.

2. **Challenge**: Handling update logic for partial fields (e.g., doctors updating `penanganan` only). <br/>
    **Solution**: Used `muted` fields in the form and Laravel controllers to ensure only the intended field is updated.
